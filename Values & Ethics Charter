Planet Hemp: Values & Ethics Charter
Preamble
By joining Planet Hemp, members commit to a paradigm shift from extractive industry to regenerative co-creation. This Charter outlines the non-negotiable ethical pillars that govern our technology, our trade, and our shared stewardship of the Earth. Membership is a pledge to uphold these values in every transaction and interaction within the ecosystem.


1. The Mortal Constraint (Human Centricity)
We recognize that the ultimate purpose of our enterprise is the preservation and enhancement of life.
Safety & Health: We prioritize materials and processes (such as non-toxic hempcrete) that ensure a healthy, carbon-negative habitat for all.
Well-being: We reject any practice that compromises the physiological or psychological safety of our members or the public.


2. Biological Integrity & Phytoremediation
The hemp plant is our teacher and our tool for healing the planet.
Ecological First-Principle: Every industrial action must strive for a net-positive impact on biodiversity.
Soil Stewardship: We commit to regenerative farming practices that clean the soil (phytoremediation) and sequester carbon, moving beyond “sustainability” toward active restoration.


3. Regenerative Justice & Fair Trade
Wealth in the Planet Hemp ecosystem is derived from ecological performance and equitable participation.
The Regenerative Premium: We uphold the Fair Trade Policy, ensuring that farmers and local practitioners receive a premium for verified regenerative outcomes.
Anti-Exploitation: We strictly forbid child labor, forced labor, or any form of economic exploitation within our supply chains.


4. Data Sovereignty & Digital Ethics
In a high-tech cooperative, data is the lifeblood of trust.
Individual Ownership: Every member owns their Digital Imprint. We will never sell or monetize member data without explicit, informed consent.
Algorithmic Transparency: We commit to “Open Box” AI. The logic behind our GreenWeaver AI and Market Synergy algorithms must remain auditable by the membership.


5. Radically Decentralized Transparency
Trust is verified, not assumed.
Immutable Provenance: We use the Decentralized Supply Chain Ledger (DSCL) to provide an honest account of every product’s journey, from seed to shelf.
Open Governance: All major policy decisions within The Nexus are recorded on-chain, ensuring that the Agentic Will of the collective is always visible and verifiable.


6. The Commons Mandate
Knowledge is a shared resource.
HempNet Commons: While we respect commercial patents where necessary for innovation, we prioritize open-sourcing foundational blueprints and regenerative techniques to accelerate global healing.


The Pledge
“I recognize that I am a steward of the Planet Hemp ecosystem. I pledge to act with integrity, to value the biology of our world as much as the technology of our age, and to build a future where economy and ecology are one and the same.”
