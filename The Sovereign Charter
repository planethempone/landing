Article I: Sovereignty of Governance (The Gavel)

Section 1.1: Voting Authority
The Sovereign possesses Tier-1 voting weight on all proposals submitted to the Cooperative DAO (Decentralized Autonomous Organization). This includes, but is not limited to:
Allocation of the Resilience Fund for ecological and industrial projects.
Approval of new Regulatory Sandbox initiatives.
Amendments to the Declaration of Global Hemp Sovereignty.
Veto power over proposals deemed to violate the Protagoras Principle (AI alignment with human wisdom and ecosystem health).

Section 1.2: Validator Mandate
Sovereigns are designated as Verified Validators on the Global Hemp Ledger. Their cryptographic signatures are required to finalize new block entries, verifying the authenticity of Verified Hemp Carbon Credits and the integrity of the “Human Imprint” data.



Article II: Sovereignty of Innovation (The Blueprint)

Section 2.1: Developer Hub Access
Sovereigns gain expedited access and priority review for all submissions to the Developer Hub. This includes:
Fast-tracking of monolithic 3D-printing designs for bio-composites.
Priority for Regenerative Intelligence (RI) algorithm contributions to the Nexus.
Direct API integration with the Eco-Guardian Network for advanced sensor deployment.

Section 2.2: Regulatory Sandbox Initiation
The Sovereign is empowered to initiate and sponsor new Regulatory Sandboxes. This involves presenting a detailed project proposal to the Policy Nexus for review, leveraging aggregated Nexus data to demonstrate feasibility and ecological benefit.



Article III: Sovereignty of Legacy (The Vault)

Section 3.1: Root Access to Cold Bridge
Sovereigns are granted “Root Access” to the Cold Bridge Permanent Knowledge Vaults. This ensures:
Unrestricted access to historical data, encrypted blueprints, and scientific research stored across the decentralized Cooperative Data Server Network.
The ability to contribute directly to the archiving and preservation of the Green Renaissance’s intellectual property.

Section 3.2: Mentorship and Leadership
Sovereigns are invited to act as mentors within the HempNet Commons, guiding nascent Eco-Guardians and Architects. They hold a recognized leadership role within the Global Hemp Nation, embodying the principles of Protector, Builder, Leader.



Article IV: Responsibilities of The Sovereign

Section 4.1: Ethical Stewardship
All actions undertaken by a Sovereign must align with the foundational principles of ecological regeneration, data integrity, and decentralized cooperation. Misuse of privileges or actions detrimental to the cooperative’s mission will result in a review by the Planet Hemp Leadership Council.

Section 4.2: Continuous Contribution
While 5,000 XP marks the achievement of Sovereign status, active engagement is expected. Continued contribution to the network (e.g., validating transactions, submitting proposals, maintaining nodes) sustains the Sovereign’s influence and voting weight within the Equity Index 2.0.

Ratified by the Consensus of the Global Hemp Nation.
