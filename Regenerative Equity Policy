Planet Hemp Fair Trade and Regenerative Equity Policy
Document Version: 1.0 Effective Date: 20251122



I. Introduction and Scope
This Fair Trade and Regenerative Equity Policy outlines the mandatory standards for economic, social, and environmental conduct for all suppliers, producers, and partners operating within the Planet Hemp cooperative ecosystem. Our policy transcends conventional fair trade by integrating regenerative agriculture mandates and ensuring end-to-end transparency via blockchain technology.

This policy is designed to uphold the principle of equity in the value chain, ensuring that the sustainable practices inherent in hemp cultivation translate into verifiable, premium value for all stakeholders, particularly grassroots farmers and local processing units.



II. Core Policy Pillars

Pillar 1: Economic Justice and Fair Pricing
We commit to financial models that stabilize income and reward sustainable practices, mitigating the volatility inherent in traditional commodity markets.
Guaranteed Fair Price and Living Wage Premium: All primary producers (farmers and growers) shall receive a price that covers the full cost of sustainable production, plus a Regenerative Premium. This premium rewards adherence to advanced ecological standards (e.g., verified soil health metrics).
Transparent Cost Analysis: The methodology for calculating the Fair Price shall be transparently communicated and subject to review by the cooperative’s governance bodies.
Access to Financial Inclusion: Planet Hemp will prioritize financial services and loans for cooperative members, leveraging Regenerative Finance (ReFi) models that link positive environmental performance to lower interest rates and investment priority.
Prompt Payment: Suppliers must receive payment within 30 days of verified delivery and quality assurance (QA) confirmation.

Pillar 2: Social Equity, Labor, and Development
We commit to fostering an inclusive and empowering environment, recognizing the vital role of human capital in sustainable development.
Ethical Labor Standards: Strict adherence to international labor laws, including prohibition of forced labor, child labor, and discrimination. All workers must be provided with safe working conditions and wages that meet or exceed local living wage standards.
Inclusivity and Grassroots Empowerment: The cooperative structure mandates support for smallholder farmers and previously marginalized communities, providing technical assistance and preferential off-take agreements to ensure broad economic participation.
Knowledge & Skill Equity: Planet Hemp shall provide all worker members and co-op farmers with access to educational modules (via the DOCS platform) focused on modern processing techniques, safety protocols, and DLT implementation, effectively rewarding education through compliance enablement.
Health and Well-being: Producers and processors must adhere to established workplace safety standards, providing protective gear and ensuring working hours are compatible with overall health and well-being.

Pillar 3: Environmental Stewardship and Regenerative Mandate
This policy requires a commitment to practices that actively restore and enhance the environment, aligning with the principles of the circular economy.
Regenerative Cultivation: All hemp cultivated for Planet Hemp must adhere to established regenerative agriculture protocols, focusing on soil carbon sequestration, minimization of chemical inputs, and maximum biodiversity gain.
Water & Land Stewardship: Suppliers must demonstrate water-efficient farming techniques and commit to land-use practices that prevent soil erosion and promote phytoremediation (soil cleaning, where applicable).
Zero-Waste Principle: All suppliers must participate in the cooperative’s waste-stream management system, ensuring that biomass residuals (hurds, leaves) are routed for further value creation (e.g., construction materials or bio-composites), driving maximum circularity.

Pillar 4: Transparency and Technological Accountability
Transparency is guaranteed by leveraging the technical infrastructure of The Hemp Nation Group.
DLT/Blockchain Traceability: All certified products must have their cultivation, processing, and QA data immutably recorded on the Decentralized Supply Chain Ledger. This provides end-users and investors with end-to-end traceability of the material’s environmental and social journey.
Verifiable Metrics: Compliance with the Regenerative Premium criteria (Pillar 1) is verified using digital tools (e.g., satellite monitoring data, GreenWeaver AI metrics) before payment is issued, ensuring that financial reward is directly linked to ecological performance.



III. Enforcement and Review
Monitoring: Compliance will be monitored through a combination of DLT verification, remote sensing, and periodic, formalized Peer-to-Peer Audits conducted by cooperative inspectors.
Consequences of Non-Compliance: Violations of this policy will result in corrective action plans, temporary suspension of off-take agreements, and, for persistent non-compliance, permanent exclusion from the Planet Hemp cooperative network.
Policy Review: This policy will be formally reviewed and updated annually by the cooperative’s Ethics & Data Governance Committee, ensuring it remains relevant and responsive to evolving international regulations and technological advancements.
